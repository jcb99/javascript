//This is bad:
//a;


//Types of expressions
//===========================
//1. Variable Declaration

//Assign a value
//a=4;

//Perform an evaluation that returns a single value
//b + c


let b =3;
let c = 2;

//There are actually exactly 3 different expressions in this single statement
let = a = b + c;

//1. Let a .... (A variable declaration)
//2. b + c .... Performing an evaluation of b + c using the addition operator
//3. a =   .... The result of b + c is assinged to a
